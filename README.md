# Reference Sheets
24 December 2015

Here you can find my reference sheets for some of my classes at
UCLA. As for my regular class notes, most are written in Markdown (and will be
posted soon on my personal site) or handwritten (not likely to be useful to
many people).


## Licensing

The reference sheets are licensed under the terms of the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. In other words, 
share freely, including any changes you make, but it must be under these
same terms. Finally, these sheets, along with any derivatives, should never
be sold. Knowledge should be free. 

[Contact me](https://kycode.me/contact/) if there are any licensing concerns; I'd be happy to help.


## Hacking

If you plan on editing the `.tex` files and don't already know
how to use LaTeX, then see the excellent [Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for instructions. [Let me know](https://kycode.me/contact/)
if you find any errors and I'll be happy to correct them. You can also
[open a pull request](https://github.com/KyCodeHuynh/Reference-Sheets/compare). If you haven't done this before, see the [GitHub guide](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on them.

Happy studying,

Ky-Cuong Huynh
